Official ByteVerse Hackathon Solution

Team Name - The Web's Watch 

## Core Idea
To build a web app which would allow farmers to directly interact with the customers

## Project Objective
- Farmers and customers can login and register
- Farmers can list their products
- Customers can purchase the product and give feedback about it
- Farmers can access tools  like weather and getting information about a crop by the crop name
- Farmers can post updates about their harvests
- Customers can follow or connect to a farmer
- Customers can chat with farmers after connecting
- Customers and farmers can donate to each other
- Farmers can follow and connect to other farmers
- Customers can invest in farmers

## Current Functionality
- Farmers and customers can login and register
- Farmers can access tools  like weather and getting information about a crop by the crop name

## Technologies and tool being used:
- React :- for frontend
- Tailwind CSS
- NodeJs & ExpressJs :- for server and api
- PassportJS :- For authentication
- bcrypt :- For password hashing
- PostgreSQL :- Database
- Render :- For hosting the backend
- Clever Cloud :- For hosting the database

[Github repository of Backend](https://github.com/rshakash/angkor-backend)

## Summary
We implemented authentication and authorization with help of passportjs, bcrypt, expressjs, react router and PostgreSQL database. Then we hosted the backend on the render as a web service and database on clever cloud. Then we made the api for getting the information about crops with their names. Then we designed the layout for different components of farmers for desktop devices and for few componets of customers for desktop devices. 

## Future plans for the remainder of Hackathon
- To complete layouts of all pages of both customers and farmers
- To make app responsive
- Let farmers list their products and post their updates
- Let customers follow and connect to farmers
- Let farmers follow and connect to other farmers
